# ImgurSwitcher
Python script designed to run in the background and read keyboard events to change your background picture from an Imgur album.

Currently Windows only :(

# Prereqs
Need pyHook for Python 3(.5), available as an unofficial .whl file [here.](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) 
Download it somewhere on your computer and then run `pip install <path to file you just downloaded>`.
Alternatively, [download the source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/) and fix it up a bit to work with Python 3 (I have not done it using this method, but it should work).
