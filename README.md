# ImgurSwitcher
Python 3.5 script designed to run in the background and read keyboard events to change your background picture from an Imgur album.

Currently Windows only :(

# Prereqs
Need pyHook for Python 3(.5), available as an unofficial .whl file [here.](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) Make sure this file matches your setup of Python (version/32 or 64 bit).
Download it somewhere on your computer and then run `pip install <path to file you just downloaded>`.
Alternatively, [download the source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/) and fix it up a bit to work with Python 3 (I have not done it using this method, but it should work).

Also need PythonCOM, available from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/). Download the `.exe` that matches your Python setup (version/32 or 64 bit) and run it to install. There does not seem to be a `pip` package available for Python 3.5 yet (as of 2015-11-03), so this is what's needed to install.
